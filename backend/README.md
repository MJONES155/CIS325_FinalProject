# CIS325_FinalProject

Disclosure Statement: I, Megan Jones, worked independently and created a lot of this code (especially on the backend). However, ChatGPT and Google were used to help clarify some steps and coding ideas that I was not clear on. 
I was also given rough outlines by my teacher, Jason Owen, to create CRUD and API endpoints. Comments are added throughout to show my understanding of code and guide others who 
read it. I put a lot of work into making this code run, so I hope it is enjoyed :)

Purpose: This application is a web application designed for task management.
